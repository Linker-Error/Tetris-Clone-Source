# Tetris-Clone-Source
The source code for my Tetris clone (for recompilation on other systems)

## Compilation
Compiling requires Raylib, and I recommend Visual C++ assuming you can use it. If you are a Windows user only interested in playing the game, go to https://github.com/Linker-Error/Tetris-Clone.
