# Tetris-Clone-Source
The source code for my Tetris clone (for recompilation on other systems)

## Compilation
Compiling requires Raylib, and I recommend Visual C++ assuming you can use it. Please note that all the assets and images are not in this repository. To compile, got to the release page and take the resources folder out of the archive. Then put the folder wherever you are building to. If you are a Windows user only interested in playing the game, go to https://github.com/Linker-Error/Tetris-Clone.
